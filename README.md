# Small_Projects
Various projects that I have worked on that don't fill into their own repository. <br>
Most of this will be me testing out new frameworks or programming languages. <br>
I am learning how to use them, and making some basic functionality with them.

### Projects include:

Signup/Login form with password hashing and json storage of users.

.NET Blazor Web Application w/ Prototype Clicker Game
