## Note
No actually functionality as of yet. Just displays a window on clicking the button. Going to add conditionals and form a database eventually.

## If running for yourself
ensure that the requirements in requirements.txt are met, otherwise the window may not appear as it should, and deprecation warnings may appear. 

This configuration avoids any warnings any syncs the window theme with your windows theme.
