## Note
Functionality is slowing being added to the signup and login form. Currently it has very limited usage.

## If running for yourself
ensure that the requirements in requirements.txt are met, otherwise the window may not appear as it should, and deprecation warnings may appear. 

This configuration avoids any warnings and syncs the theme with your windows theme.
